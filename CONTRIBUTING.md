# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Marjahan's demo app. This is a trimmed contributing guide with basic expectations.

1. Fork and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Follow commit message conventions: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`.
3. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` before opening a PR.
4. Add tests for any new logic and keep changes focused.
5. Use small PRs and request reviews from maintainers.

Code style is enforced via ESLint and Prettier. Husky runs lint-staged on pre-commit.
